# Cryptographic Operations
Cryptographic Operations in Python 

## Build
To build the app make sure rsa and argparse are installed. These can be easily installed using pip.

pip install rsa

pip install argparse

I chose to work with the rsa package because it is lightweight and easy to use/understand while providing all the desired functionality.
